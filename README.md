Implementation of MD and MC algorithms on fpga, using altera's opencl compiler, compare results with GPGPU implementation

MC_one_to_all - consider iteractions between specific particle and all others inside kernel, while MC consider iteractions between pairs of particles inside kernel.
I suppose, both methods can be usefull in different potentials, so for now I will maintain both of them in one branch.
